 Upgrading MediaGoblin
======================

Preparation
-----------

*ALWAYS* take a backup before upgrading, especially before running migrations. That
way if something goes wrong, we can fix things.

Although not strictly necessary, we recommend you shut down your current
MediaGoblin/Celery processes before upgrading.


Upgrade
-------

1. Update to the latest release.  In your ``mediagoblin`` directory, run::

     git fetch && git checkout -q v0.12.0 && git submodule update

2. Remove your existing installation::

     make distclean

3. Recreate the virtual environment and install MediaGoblin::

     ./bootstrap.sh && VIRTUALENV_FLAGS='--system-site-packages' ./configure && make

4. Update the database::

     ./bin/gmg dbupdate

5. Restart the Paster and Celery processes. If you followed ":doc:`deploying`",
   this may be something like::

     sudo systemctl restart mediagoblin-paster.service
     sudo systemctl start mediagoblin-celeryd.service

   To see the logs for troubleshooting, use something like::

     sudo journalctl -u mediagoblin-paster.service -f
     sudo journalctl -u mediagoblin-celeryd.service -f

6. View your site and hover your cursor over the "MediaGoblin" link in the
   footer to confirm the version number you're running.


Updating your system Python
---------------------------

Upgrading your operating system or installing a new major version of Python may
break MediaGoblin. This typically occurs because Python virtual environment is
referring to a copy of Python that no longer exists. In this situation use the
same process for "Upgrade" above.
