Further Considerations for Production Deployments
=================================================

This page extends upon our ":doc:`deploying`" guide to describe some common
issues affecting production deployments.

.. _enable-registration:

Should I Keep Open Registration Enabled?
----------------------------------------

Unfortunately, enabling public registrations in MediaGoblin will usually result
in many thousands of automated spam registrations. Spam accounts will typically
remain un-activated, but the volume alone may cause poor performance on your
site. For this reason, registrations are disabled by default and we recommend
against enabling public registration.

Should you choose to enable registration, you can update in your mediagoblin.ini
like so::

     [mediagoblin]
     allow_registration = false

Alternatively, you may wish to just make accounts for people you know and trust
(eg via the `gmg adduser` command).

A further option may be to enable a CAPTCHA plugin. But unfortunately, though
some CAPTCHA plugins exist, for various reasons we do not have any general
recommendations we can make at this point. We hope to provide a better solution
to this problem in the future.


Confidential Files
------------------

.. warning::

   The directory ``user_dev/crypto/`` contains confidential information. In
   particular, the ``itsdangeroussecret.bin`` is important for the security of
   login sessions. Make sure not to publish its contents anywhere. If the
   contents gets leaked nevertheless, delete your file and restart the server,
   so that it creates a new secret key. All previous login sessions will be
   invalidated.


.. _background-media-processing:

Background Media Processing
---------------------------

":doc:`deploying`" covers use of a separate Celery process, but this sections
describes this in more detail.

MediaGoblin uses `Celery`_ to handle heavy and long-running tasks. Celery can
be launched in two ways:

1. **Embedded in the main MediaGoblin web application.** This is the way
   ``./lazyserver.sh`` does it for you. It's simple as you only have to run one
   process. The only bad thing with this is that the heavy and long-running
   tasks will run *in* the webserver, keeping the user waiting each time some
   heavy lifting is needed as in for example processing a video. This could lead
   to problems as an aborted connection will halt any processing and since most
   front-end web servers *will* terminate your connection if it doesn't get any
   response from the MediaGoblin web application in a while. This approach is
   suitable for development, small sites or when primarily using :doc:`command
   line uploads <commandline-upload>`.

2. **As a separate web application and media processing application
   (recommended).** In this approach, the MediaGoblin web application delegates
   all media processing to a task queue via a `broker`_ (task queue). This is
   the approach used in our :doc:`deployment guide <deploying>`, with RabbitMQ
   as the broker. This offloads the heavy lifting from the MediaGoblin web
   application and users will be able to continue to browse the site while the
   media is being processed in the background. This approach provided the best
   user experience and is recommended for production sites.

The choice between these two behaviours is controlled by the
``CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER`` environment variable. Specifying ``true`` instructs
MediaGoblin to processing media within the web application while you wait.
Specifying ``false`` instructs MediaGoblin to use background processing.

Error Monitoring with Sentry
----------------------------

We have a plugin for `raven`_ integration, see the ":doc:`/plugindocs/raven`"
documentation.

Running multiple MediaGoblin instances on the same server
---------------------------------------------------------

It is possible to run multiple separate MediaGoblin instances concurrently on
the same server. We don't provide detailed instructions to do this, but broadly,
each instance will need:

1. A separate ``mediagoblin.ini`` and ``paste.ini``.
2. A separate database that is configured in ``mediagoblin.ini``.
3. A unique ``CELERY_DEFAULT_QUEUE`` configured in ``mediagoblin.ini``. Queues
   are automatically created, but must be unique between MediaGoblin instances.
4. A separate data directory created and configured in ``mediagoblin.ini`` and
   ``paste.ini``.
5. A unique server port configured in ``paste.ini`` under ``[server:broadcast]``.

You would typically configure the web server to route requests to the
appropriate MediaGoblin instance port based on the requested domain name or
something similar.

It is also possible to share the same MediaGoblin codebase and Python virtualenv
between multiple instances, so long as they have a unique data directory.
